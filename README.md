## Zomato-Dashboard 
This Power BI project provides a comprehensive analysis of Zomato order data over a four-year period (2017-2020), focusing on key performance indicators at both the user and city levels.

The report is structured into distinct pages to facilitate a clear understanding of the data:

Overview:

User Performance: This page delves into individual user behavior, potentially exploring metrics such as order frequency, average order value, preferred cuisines, and spending patterns. Visualizations could include charts showing top users, user segmentation based on activity, and trends in individual user behavior over time.


City-wise Performance: This page provides a geographical perspective on Zomato orders, analyzing metrics like total orders, revenue generated, popular cuisines in each city, and growth trends. Visualizations might include maps highlighting city-level performance, bar charts comparing cities, and trend lines showing growth or decline in specific cities.


By examining these two perspectives in conjunction, the report aims to offer actionable insights into Zomato's business performance, identify areas of strength and weakness, and inform strategic decision-making.
